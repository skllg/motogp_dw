# items.py is a model for the extracted data. You can define a custom model 
# (like a ProductItem) that will inherit the Scrapy Item class and contain your scraped data.

# Define here the models for your scraped items
#
# See documentation in:
# https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html

import scrapy


class MotogpItem(scrapy.Item):
    # define the fields for your item here like:
    # name = scrapy.Field()
    pass
